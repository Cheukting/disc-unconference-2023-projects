# Mentee onboarding checklist

- [ ] Introduce yourselves, get to know each other and your motivation to be here
- [ ] Define the scope of mentorship
- [ ] Define timeframe and regular commitment (how often will you meet, how many hours a week you are expected to dedicate)
- [ ] Define communication channels
- [ ] Define a long-term goal of the mentorship, what both mentors and mentees would like to achieve at the end
- [ ] Share general expectations of each other beyond specific tasks and time commitment. For example
  - [ ] Participation in the broader community
  - [ ] Logging or blogging about the mentorship
  - [ ] Private versus Public communication
- [ ] Set a few short-term goals for the mentorship to start with (e.g., in 3 months), more can be added throughout the mentorship
- [ ] Make sure your mentee have access to all the tools and information they need to get started
  - [ ] Relevant communication channels
  - [ ] Write permissions on things they'll need to modify
- [ ] Clear all doubt: Remind your mentees that they are expected to ask questions, and let them know how often you expect that (you can clarify whether the questions can be asked off-line)
- [ ] Remind everyone that there is a CoC and how to report if there's any issues
- [ ] If your mentorship is scoped around completing a task or project, review timelines and goals
- [ ] Do they have any questions?
